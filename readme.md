# 🚀 RETINOPATHY PREDICTION USING ENSEMBLE LEARNING

---

## 📌 QUICK SUMMARY

A smart AI-based system for early detection of **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** using **Deep Learning** and **Machine Learning**. It leverages image processing and ensemble models to assist doctors with real-time, accurate diagnostics.

---

## 💡 KEY HIGHLIGHTS

- 🧠 **CNN** for feature extraction from retinal images  
- 🎯 **SVM** for effective classification  
- 🔗 **Ensemble Learning** for improved accuracy  
- 🖼️ **Gradio Interface** for real-time diagnosis with image upload
